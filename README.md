## Overview

Smart garbage collection system provides a platform to manage garbage collecting in a large area with proper coordination between the responsible authorities and the workers assigned to collect garbage while utilizing the available resources effectively. And also the people who are in need of a proper system to dispose garbage will be benefited by the system. The system can be implemented in cities, grounds, parks and any large public areas and it will make a high positive impact on public health & environment as well. 

## Real World Problem

The problem of proper garbage collection & disposal is a continuous struggle that we face as a country. Not only in cities but also in places like large parks, grounds, organizations such as schools, universities, offices and factories also are in need of a solution for proper garbage disposal and collection. Identifying the priorities of where and when to collect the garbage first and assigning people for different places is very hard without getting a proper overview. Therefore, the authorities assigned to do the garbage collection often end up not providing a proper service to the publlic. Complaints from the general public who are in need of a way to dispose house hold garbage are also arising because of these issues. Current garbage bin systems that are used by the public, often get overflown affecting the scenic beauty of the environment and also causing many health problems. People getting used to burn plastic, polythene because of not having a proper way to dispose house hold garbage also causes envioronmental pollution. And also garbage segregation does not happen properly when disposing garbage. Therefore, we will be addressing all these problems with our system with many other unique features that increase the standards of our product.

## Features (Planned)

### Hardware
- Sensors to get fill level of garbage.
- LED indicator(red,yellow,green) to show fill level on the garbage bin.
- Compaction mechanism along with a security sensor used to compact garbage when garbage limit is full. (Compaction happens only when security sensor identifies when bin is not used. Compaction will reduce the number of times that bins should be emptied.)
- Solar panel to get power 


### Website
- To get the overview of the garbage bin( fill level, battery capacity, garbage categories ..).
- View bins and garbage collecting employees in a map
- Add/remove new bins to the system
- Set parameter values(fill level and garbage categories) for indication of status(red,yellow,green) and to set when to do compaction process

### Mobile App

- Get the request of collecting garbage/ Accept the request/ cancel the request
- To get the information about the assigned bins
- Using map can easily locate the bin
